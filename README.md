# Fair_DecisionTree (will be updated)
Custom Implementation of Decision Tree using Fair Information Gain (FIG) in a Static Setting, Introduced in the Paper ["FAHT: An Adaptive Fairness-aware Decision Tree Classifier"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07237) by (Zhang & Ntoutsi, 2019).

Concept is explained in the PDF file with a toy example. The code is applied to the adult income dataset for experimental analysis.
